# Automated Reasoning Course Projects

Welcome to the repository containing my projects for the "Automated Reasoning" course I took during our with [Lior](https://github.com/lagron1000) studies at university.

Throughout this course, we delved into various algorithms and worked with the `pysmt` module, solving reasoning problems programmatically.

## Directory Structure and Contents

Each directory within this repository is dedicated to a specific project and contains a `README.md` file. These READMEs provide detailed explanations about the projects, including background information and instructions on how to run the code.

### Overview of Projects

1. **Horn-SAT Solver:** An implementation of a quadratic-time satisfiability solver for Horn formulas. This project showcases the algorithmic approach to solving Horn-SAT problems efficiently.

2. **Installation Problem Solver:** This project addresses the challenge of package installation where dependencies and conflicts between packages exist. The algorithm developed here aims to find a feasible installation plan that respects these dependencies and conflicts.

3. **SAT Solver:** Features implementations of both a naive satisfiability algorithm and the DPLL (Davis–Putnam–Logemann–Loveland) algorithm. This solver demonstrates the foundational approaches to solving SAT problems.

4. **Congruence Closure for Equality of Uninterpreted Functions (UF):** An implementation of the Congruence Closure algorithm tailored for theories of equality within first-order logic. This project illustrates the application of congruence closure in automated reasoning for equality reasoning.

## Getting Started

To explore and run the projects, navigate to the respective directory and refer to its `README.md` for specific setup instructions and dependencies required.
